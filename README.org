    Audio Programming MEGATHREAD!

    Hi fellas. Let's talk real(time) soykaf. Let's share your questions,
    accomplishments, tutorials and papers.

    I am a total newbie in this area, but very excited one. My first question:

    What framework would you recommend for someone who would like to create VST
    for DAWs?

 Ok, I think I will study
 [https://github.com/amsynth](https://github.com/amsynth) then I will look for
 some windows equivalent and finally I will be able to create simple multi
 platform VST & standalone synth without bloat frameworksAlso, could someone
 give me some good materials about MIDI protocol? Thanks!

 One more edit:I am currently building on Linux [https://github.com/steinbergmed
 ia/vst3sdk](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk) This look super cool,
 Idk why haven't I found this earlier.
